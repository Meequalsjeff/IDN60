# IDN60 — IDB60 Homage Case (IDB60 Mount Compatible )

A 7° 60% keyboard case designed as an homage to the IDB60 and built around the **IDB60 mounting ecosystem** (plateless o-ring bottom mount).  
**WKL only** for now.

> Note: There are **slight changes to bezel thickness** compared to real-life prototype photos.
